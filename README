== FlashX Readme

This library is slowly being converted from the old FlashX when needed. Much of it still needs converting/improvements to HaXe.

== License
FlashX is released under the MIT license and is copyright (c) 2009 Daemn (daemn.com). A copy of the MIT license can be found in the LICENSE file.


== Importing
FlashX does not use the "import" keyword (at the moment). Instead, it is used by including all source into 1 file (which is done inside include.as).


== Code Formatting
